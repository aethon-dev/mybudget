Following improvements can be done with 3rd party libraries, frameworks and bundlers

1.  Frameworks like React or Angular provide out-of-the-box support for reusable component developement. Using such a framework
    we can develop highly configurable and reusable frontend components easily with shorter development time.

2.  Third party CSS frameworks and UI kits can provide elegant and reusable styles, UI components and animations that can be 
    used directly or with minimal customization improving user experience, aesthetic look and feel, and shorter development
    time.

3.  Optimized and battle tested algorithms (ex: for searching) can be used easily with javascript utility libraries such as 
    Lodash.

4.  With the help of a unit test framework, the UI components can be tested easily improving debuggability and fault tolerance. 

5.  Using a transpiler tool like Babel would allow us to use cutting edge JS features while being able to target a wide range 
    of browers and older browser versions.

6.  Using a bundler tool such as Webpack or Parcel would allow us bundle multiple source modules into a single bundle, have 
    code splitting and on demand loading, dead code elimination and minification to reduce the bundle size significantly, 
    resulting in faster loading times.
